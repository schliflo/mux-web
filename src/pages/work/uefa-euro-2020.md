We went on a big tour through Europe to shoot a film celebrating its differences in landscape and cultures for the promotional material of the EURO 2020 - which was supposed to be held in 12 different countries for the first time. Well... then the pandemic happened and we thought this film will never see the light of day.

Yet, who would have thought - a year later we're back on. Had to cut out some really good scenes as they weren't exactly pandemic friendly but the tournament is still on and this is running on German TV.
