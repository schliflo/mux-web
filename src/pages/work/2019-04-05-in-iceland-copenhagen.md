In June 2018, we set out on a 2-week journey to Iceland & Copenhagen, enjoying two very different experiences on just one trip.

On the one side, the vastness, emptiness and otherworldly landscape of Iceland with itâ€™s almost 24 hours-daylight in summer, on the other, a modern city full of life, history and exceptional architecture.

This film is a collection of all the contrasting moments & memories we captured.
