A 3-week journey through Panama, from the Carribean island paradise of Bocas Del Toro through the lush mountain areas around Boquete all the way up to Volcan Baru, further South, from the Azuero peninsula on the Pacific to El Valle De Anton and back to the sprawl of Panama City where the Canal connects two oceans.\
While shooting a series of short commercials for Visit Panama we captured whatever we found on the trip to put together this collection of moments & sounds.
