Another entry in #LifeChangingPlaces for Lufthansa. This time, we follow a flight attendant, Maria Nolte, who went on a trip to Ethiopia and didn't only discover her love for the the landscape and culture but also decided to get involved in a local project helping women and children in need. Our team stayed all around Ethiopia for 12 days, traveling from lush mountain regions to the one of the hottest deserts on Earth.
