Hi, I'm Max Neumeier, a filmmaker, commercial video editor and sound designer from Munich, Germany. 
I started shooting and editing really crappy films of my friends skateboarding when I was about 13. It was one of many hobbies of mine for a long time but I only started taking it more seriously after having lots of free time while studying computer science in media. I half-heartedly finished my university degree while I tried to learn as much as I could doing internships and making shitty films. I became self-employed mainly as a video editor but I also produce a lot of projects on my own. It was always very important for me to at least have a good understanding of all parts of production. I've been working freelance since 2014.
